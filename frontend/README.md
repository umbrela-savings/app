# Umbrela Frontend with Expo

## Purpose for different folders

- **assets:** fonts and images.

- **components:** parts that are likely to be used repetitively.

## How to run

To be updated...

## To-do:
- [ ] have actual server code implemented
- [ ] move the styles in `./constants/Styles.js`
- [ ] update this readme file 

## Future improvements
- `AsyncStorage` from the `react-community` package is not working with Expo right now. On GitHub it says that they will update this soon
- Check if phone number is correct or not
- `Forgot password?` button does not look good on Android
